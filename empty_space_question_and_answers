Title: 
Empty Space at Bottom of "Question and Answers" Section

Description:
In the "Question and Answers" section under Settings, when scrolling to the bottom, a noticeable empty space appears below the last line of text

Steps:
1. Navigate to Settings
2. Tap "Question and Answers"
3. Scroll to the very bottom of the section

Actual Result:
After scrolling to the end, a noticeable empty space is shown below the last line of text. The content feels cut off or unfinished, and there's no more actual text to display

Expected Result:
Scrolling should stop exactly at the end of the visible content, without leaving any extra empty area. All text should appear properly aligned to the bottom with no visual gap
